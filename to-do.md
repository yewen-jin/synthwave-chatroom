# List of tasks to do next

[] fix the game initiation mechanism. Once game finishes, do not restart, and the narrator room initiation button should not be grayed out.
[] narrator messages no longer need to pop up in narrator room, just go to the messages.
[] add a pause game option, where the narrator can pause the interaction, and add whatever texts
[] images: click to enlarge, click 'X' on top right corner to close
[] edit styling, enlarge texts, maybe remove the top status bar or move it to the side to allow more space for conversation
[] further edit conversation texts, splitting between player option that goes into chat, adding "" in the option, and options that trigger the next node without sending anything to chat (consider if/when this should happen)
[] ==CLICK TO PLAY== shouldn't be in the chat. Maybe in the popup window
[] before the game finishes, the typing should be disabled/grayed out, until the end of the game
