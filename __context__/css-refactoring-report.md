### Prompt

first read through the files in **context** folder to understand what I'm trying to do, and look through the src folder and understand the project structure and pages. then I want you to refactor the style.css to make it more concise and efficient, while maintaining all the styles and not change how it looks. It should look exactly as before refactoring. And at the end, give me a report of what you did and explain why you're doing it, and finally in the style.css, use comment to show me what each block of code is meant to do. pay special attention to control.html, which contains multiple presets of the color scheme. I want to make sure these functions stay intact.

also, keep in mind the following:
Organize the file into sections (Reset, Variables, Typography, Layout, Components).

DO NOT Use Native CSS Nesting

Use CSS Variables for all colors and spacing.

Avoid utility-first classes; keep it component-based."

Combine redundant selectors.
